## Eductional material :green_book:

### [Web development cheat-sheet](https://github.com/EvTsoy/webdevelopment-notes)

A Web development Cheat Sheet - simple collection of additional Laravel explanations helpful when taking the course, but also for everyone else not enrolled. A little bit of shortcuts, code chunks, tables and diagrams.
